Random little repo for stuff I put together for my [Dirtywave M8](https://dirtywave.com/) that may be useful to others.

Likely the main attraction will be the PowerShell script I've put together to convert sound library folders into a format more suitable for the device.  I use this to downsample etc. things for my Elektron gear, and it works well for auto-reducing samples to 44100Hz/16-bit for M8 usage too.

Everything here should be mine directly, and I hereby licence as unlicenced - do what you want with anything in here, with or without credit **EXCEPT FOR ANY FILES THAT HAVE THEIR OWN LICENCE FILE**.  I'm not *planning* on restricting anything, but, y'know, just in case...
